Problem Statement

Solution: SolutionTwoSum
1.You are given an array of integers nums and an integer target. Your task is to find two distinct indices i and j such that the sum of nums[i] and nums[j] is equal to the target. You can assume that each input will have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Examples
Example 1:

Input: [3, 2, 4], 6
Expected Output: [1, 2]
Justification: nums[1] + nums[2] gives 2 + 4 which equals 6.
Example 2:

Input: [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5], -8
Expected Output: [2, 4]
Justification: nums[2] + nums[4] yields -3 + (-5) which equals -8.
Example 3:

Input: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30], 45
Expected Output: [1, 3]
Justification: nums[1] + nums[3] gives 15 + 30 which equals 45
